# Production readiness

What stands between swiftdc and a decompiler whose output can be trusted without
hand-checking it. Organised by **risk**, not by feature appeal.

Each item is `[status] claim — evidence`. Status is one of **OPEN**, **FIXED**,
**MITIGATED**, or **UNKNOWN**. *UNKNOWN means nobody has measured it* — it is not
a synonym for "probably fine", and an UNKNOWN in Soundness or Completeness
outranks an OPEN in Reconstruction quality.

Every claim here should carry either a commit, a file:line, or a command you can
re-run. Claims without one are marked UNKNOWN by definition.

## 1. Soundness — can it fabricate or misattribute semantics?

The highest-severity category. A wrong render is worse than a missing one,
because it cannot be distinguished from a right one by reading the output.

- **FIXED — unsigned comparisons rendered as signed.** `cset w0, lo` (unsigned)
  used to render `(arg0 < 10)`, which evaluates differently from the machine at
  negative inputs. Fixed in `2be9e31` via a per-value type lattice carrying
  signedness. Verified at HEAD: `x >= 0 && x < 10` at `-O` renders
  `((0 <= arg0) && (arg0 < 10))`; a genuinely signed `x < 10` renders
  `(arg0 < 10)`. Unknown signedness renders an explicit `<ᵁ` rather than
  guessing.
- **FIXED — field-map name collisions fabricated fields.** Two types sharing a
  simple name let one type's layout name the other's fields. Ambiguous simple
  names are now dropped, and qualified keys recover the precise layout
  (`0237af1`, `1ec5872`, `f423666`).
- **MITIGATED — the decline-rather-than-guess rule.** Verified as systematic, not
  incidental: `.unknown` renders `?` (`Disassembler.swift:2322`); the structurer
  refuses to structure an unprovable branch (`Structurer.swift:214`); `clobber`
  is deliberately over-pessimistic because under-clobbering "leaves a stale value
  that renders as a confident, fabricated" one (`ValueTracking.swift:1583`);
  fixed-ABI callee args are clamped to real arity so a stale register cannot
  surface as a trailing argument.
- **MITIGATED — `self` is conservative.** x20 is read as `self` only for a
  Swift-mangled callee and only when freshly written (`Disassembler.swift:2847`,
  `ValueTracking.swift:636`). Deliberate false-negative-over-false-positive.
- **MITIGATED — field naming requires two independent halves.** Receiver type
  known AND offset inside the type's trusted prefix; the `isInstance` flag
  refuses metatypes. Consulting the symbol first (which lacks that flag) produced
  a real `swift_allocObject(self, …)` fabrication before the ordering was fixed.
- **OPEN — `X → self.layout` imprecision.** LayoutWrapper structs over `__C`
  types render the whole `self.layout` because the backing C struct has no Swift
  field metadata. A *real* field name at the wrong granularity — imprecise, not
  fabricated. Needs C-struct field data.
- **UNKNOWN — no differential oracle.** Nothing systematically compares recovered
  semantics against ground truth (SIL, or executing both). Soundness is currently
  established by targeted adversarial tests, which cannot prove absence of
  fabrication. **This is the single largest gap in the category.**

## 2. Completeness — what does it silently omit?

Silent omission is the worst failure mode: it is indistinguishable from a
correct empty answer. See the empty-result rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

- **FIXED — whole-binary disassembly returned nothing on most dylibs.**
  llvm-objdump right-aligns its address column; the parser required
  `allSatisfy(isHexDigit)` on everything before the first colon, so every
  instruction line of a low-based binary was dropped. Reported
  `// No functions matched.` — 0 functions where the binary had 446 (`d1ca94f`).
- **FIXED — the guard against that class.** An empty parse is now cross-checked
  against `LC_FUNCTION_STARTS` and throws `DisassembleError.parsedNothing` with
  both counts rather than returning `[]`.
- **FIXED — the Capstone whole-image decode stopped at the first undecodable
  byte.** `cs_disasm` halts at the first byte sequence it cannot decode and
  returns the count so far; the engine called it *once* and took that as the
  decode. `__text` is full of things that stall it — inline data, alignment
  padding, jump tables, unknown arm64e forms — so every whole-image decode
  truncated at the first one.

  The prior entry here recorded "~285 functions" as a modest shortfall. Adding
  the coverage metric reframed it: **285 of 105,647 declared functions, 0.27%**,
  decoding 4,040 instructions over 16,160 contiguous bytes before stopping
  silently. The listing looked entirely normal. ARM64's fixed 4-byte width makes
  recovery exact rather than heuristic — on a stall, skip one instruction slot
  and resume — so the fix carries no realignment guesswork.

  Covered by `CapstoneResyncTests`, which pins the resync *stride* (a
  wrong-sized skip still yields the right instruction count at wrong addresses),
  and was observed failing against the single-call decode before being trusted.
- **OPEN — names for statically-dispatched Swift on stripped binaries.** Free
  functions, closures, thunks, and struct/enum non-protocol methods render
  `sub_<addr>`. Boundaries recover; names have no metadata record to recover
  *from*. Partly inherent.
- **OPEN — unresolved indirect call edges.** Generic witness tables, unknown
  receiver vtables, and block pointers stay unresolved. `xrefs` reports the
  count, so this is *disclosed* rather than silent — but `--unreferenced` is
  therefore not a dead-code proof.
- **MITIGATED — recovery coverage is now reported.** An unfiltered run that
  recovers under half of what `LC_FUNCTION_STARTS` declares warns on stderr with
  both counts and a percentage (stdout stays pipeable). This is the
  "unusually small" half of the empty-result rule; the empty case throws.
  It is what turned the SwiftUI shortfall from a vague "~285" into a diagnosis.
- **UNKNOWN — byte-level coverage.** Function-count coverage is reported, but
  nothing measures what fraction of `__text` *bytes* decode, so a function
  recovered with a truncated body still counts as recovered.

## 3. Robustness — what breaks it?

- **OPEN — a truncated Mach-O crashes.** A 204-byte file with a valid magic
  aborts inside the dependency: `MachOKit/MachOFile.swift:61: Fatal error: 'try!'
  expression unexpectedly raised an error`. Exit code 133 (SIGTRAP). A `try!` in
  a dependency **cannot be caught** — mitigation must be validation *before* the
  call, the same shape as the documented `MachOFile.symbols` trap.
  Reproduce: `printf '\xcf\xfa\xed\xfe' > t; head -c 200 /dev/urandom >> t; swiftdc disasm t`
- **MITIGATED — other malformed inputs degrade cleanly.** Random bytes →
  `Error: Not a Mach-O file`, exit 1. A truncated-but-parseable binary →
  `llvm-objdump failed: …`, exit 1. Both correct.
- **FIXED — structurer stack overflow on deep CFGs** (`ca82d6f`).
- **FIXED — spurious dyld-cache markers trapped ObjC index construction**
  (covered by `buildsObjCIndexWithoutTrappingOnSpuriousCacheMarkers`).
- **MITIGATED — `MachOFile.symbols` fatalErrors on cache images** whose
  `__LINKEDIT` sits in another subcache. Uncatchable; avoided by reading the
  export trie instead, which is also semantically correct.
- **UNKNOWN — fuzzing.** No corpus, no fuzz harness. Given that one hand-written
  truncation found a crash in minutes, the expected yield is high.
- **UNKNOWN — behavior across optimization levels.** `-Onone` and `-O` lower
  differently and fixtures exist for both, but no systematic sweep asserts that
  a construct proven at one level holds at the other.

## 4. Determinism

- **MITIGATED — output is stable across runs.** Three consecutive
  `disasm --structured` runs over the fixture hash identically:
  `for i in 1 2 3; do swiftdc disasm Fixtures/Sample/libReconstruction.dylib --structured | shasum; done`
  Tests additionally pin a shared symbol-index store (`withStableDependencies`),
  which suggests dependency-injection order once mattered.
- **UNKNOWN — determinism under concurrency.** The pipeline is `async`. Nothing
  asserts that iteration order over dictionaries/sets cannot leak into output on
  a larger binary, where scheduling varies more.

## 5. Performance and memory on large frameworks

- **OPEN — whole-image decoding does not scale to the largest frameworks.**
  Measured after the resync fix: `disasm --image UserNotifications` recovers
  1,391 functions / 52,103 instructions in **19s**, with no coverage warning.
  SwiftUI declares 105,647 functions — roughly 75× more — and a full unfiltered
  run takes many minutes.

  This cost was previously *hidden by the truncation bug*: stopping after 4,040
  instructions made SwiftUI look fast. Fixing completeness exposed the real
  workload, which is the correct trade (a fast wrong answer is worth nothing)
  but leaves unfiltered runs on the largest images impractical.

  Not pathological — the resync loop was checked for a degenerate
  one-call-per-4-bytes case on a large data region and UserNotifications shows
  none. It is the per-instruction analysis pipeline, run over ~75× more code.
  `--function` remains fast on any image, since it decodes only matched ranges.
- **UNKNOWN — memory.** Peak RSS on a large framework has never been measured.
  The whole-image path holds every instruction and every recovered function in
  memory at once, with no streaming or chunking.
- **UNKNOWN — no performance regression guard.** Nothing fails when a change
  makes decoding materially slower.

## 6. Usability — are commands, diagnostics, and docs accurate?

- **FIXED — three README defects.** A documented command that errors
  (`--sections types,protocols` is space-separated); an entire undocumented
  subcommand (`layout`, including the `--self-index` flag that produces numbers
  the README cited); a stale measurement (49/33 → re-measured 60/39). `f549857`.
- **FIXED — the ambiguous empty-result message.** `// No functions matched.`
  covered three distinct causes including a parser failure. Now distinguishes
  "no function matched `<filter>`" from "this binary contains no recoverable
  functions", and an analysis failure throws instead.
- **FIXED — two stale doc artifacts.** A fixed defect still headlined
  `CONFIRMED DEFECT`; a shipped feature still described as "a scoped follow-up".
- **MITIGATED — exit codes are correct** except the crash above: success 0,
  bad input 1, filter-miss 0.
- **UNKNOWN — no progress or timing feedback.** `objc --image Foundation` is
  documented as slow with no indication it is working.

## 7. Reconstruction quality — how source-like is the output?

Real, but last. Everything above must hold first.

- **OPEN — L1: locals are inlined, not promoted.** `let a = x+1; let b = a*2;
  return a+b` renders `((arg0 + 1) + ((arg0 + 1) * 2))` — value-correct, but
  subexpressions are recomputed and no named locals exist. Ghidra promotes stack
  slots to `HighVariable`s. A design gap, not a bug.
- **OPEN — S1: struct-parameter decomposition is method-only.** Small integer
  structs decompose in getters (`e1a3b6a`, `73eaf73`); free-function HFA params
  (`dot(p: Point, q: Point)`) still decline.
- **OPEN — closures, existentials, generic witnesses, `throws`, `async`** render
  as low-level runtime calls rather than reconstructed control flow. Honest
  declines; large surface.
- **PLATEAU — condition naming.** ~70% of raw-register conditions are compiler
  plumbing (value witnesses, generic specializations, Codable machinery) with no
  source-level named value to recover. Investigated and documented as
  coverage-bound in `docs/research/field-map-name-collision.md`. Not a tractable
  slice; do not re-mine it without new evidence.

## 8. Validation — what independent oracle checks each subsystem?

The meta-category. Every gap here weakens confidence in every claim above.

| Subsystem | Oracle | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Function boundaries | `LC_FUNCTION_STARTS` | **Enforced** — throws on empty parse, warns below 50% recovery |
| Instruction decode | `llvm-objdump` vs in-process Capstone | Two independent decoders exist; **nothing cross-checks them**. Both silent-truncation bugs found so far were in whichever decoder the other wasn't covering |
| Enum tag → case index | SIL (`swiftc -emit-sil`) | Used once, manually, to confirm the `rank` lowering |
| Field offsets | `__swift5_fieldmd`, computed offline | Runtime-exact by construction |
| Cross-image symbols | export trie | Used as the primary source |
| Recovered semantics | — | **None.** The largest gap. No differential execution, no SIL comparison in CI |
| Whole-binary output | — | **None.** No golden-output corpus, so a silent regression on a real framework would not be noticed |

The two decoders being cross-checkable against each other is the cheapest
unexploited oracle in the project: the objdump path and the Capstone path decode
the same bytes, and the bug in `d1ca94f` existed precisely because only one of
them was ever exercised end to end.
